**Fitness Diet Tracker**

Fitness Diet Tracker is a Java-FX based program that allows users to create profiles, add fitness goals, and track all their previous activity. In order to run from the command line you must make sure you have all 3 parameters that are important for storing/receiving user data. They should be inputted as followed; 

src/main/resources/com/example/fitnesstrackergp_gui/profiles.csv 

src/main/resources/com/example/fitnesstrackergp_gui/goals.csv 

src/main/resources/com/example/fitnesstrackergp_gui/meals.csv

If the program is passed with less than 3 parameters, it will not launch the welcome page and instead output a message in the console.
This project makes use of Git for version control, Intellij IDEA for developmental purposes, JUnit in order to test, and Java-FX for GUI creation.

**Features:**

**Create Profiles:** Program will ask for username, age, height, weight, and gender.

**View Profile:** Will be able to view previously entered info and also see a calculated basal metabolic rate.

**Fitness Goal Setting:** Program will ask a few questions after retrieving profile and that will then be saved.

**Log Daily Meals:** Will be able to enter current date and all meals eaten that day that will be stored.

**View Diet History:** Program retrieves and displays meal history and calculates to show average calorie intake.

**View Fitness Goals:** Will retrieve profile and also lets the user know recommended sleep duration/duration of workout per day.

**Usage**

This project can be used in order to get a better understanding of your fitness goals, and the steps one must take to achieve them. We provide an understanding of the required workout duration per day and the recommended sleep hours associated with the profile information.
